# KNNAlgorithmUsingPandas
 k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. 
 KNN is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions).
 This jupyter notebook makes use of pandas library to implement KNN algorithm using Dataframe
