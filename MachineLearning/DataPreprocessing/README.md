# DataPreprocessing
 Data Preprocessing is a technique that transforms raw data to understandable format

Real world data is often inconsistent, noisy , contains missing values. To perform different operations on data and to apply different Machine learning algorithms, we need to make data consistent. 

Data Preprocessing is a method to remove such inconsistencies or noisiness from data .

Different techniques used to perform Data preprocessing:
1. Label encoder
2. Mapping features
3. One Hot encoding: There are two ways to apply One Hot encoding technique to perform data preprocessing:
	a. pd.get_dummies
	b. sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder
