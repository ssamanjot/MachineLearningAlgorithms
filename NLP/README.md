# **Topic Modelling**
Topic modelling, in the context of Natural Language Processing, is described as a method of uncovering hidden structure in a collection of texts.

Topic modeling is a form of dimensionality reduction.

Topic modeling can be easily compared to clustering. As in the case of clustering, the number of topics, like the number of clusters, is a hyperparameter. By doing topic modeling we build clusters of words rather than clusters of texts. A text is thus a mixture of all the topics, each having a certain weight.

Topic Modeling Algorithms
>There are several algorithms for doing topic modeling. The most popular ones include

>LDA – Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
>LSA or LSI – Latent Semantic Analysis or Latent Semantic Indexing
